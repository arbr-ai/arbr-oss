# Platform

- arbr-platform-object-graph: Functionality and common components of the Object Graph engine. Prefer interfaces and abstractions over concrete implementations, specific API integrations, etc. For now, execution and engine components should live elsewhere
- arbr-platform-base: Library-like implementations of shared components for the platform
- arbr-platform-spring-autoconfigure: Spring configurations for easier setup and separation of config from functionality
